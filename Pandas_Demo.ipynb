        "The last problem in the problem set asks the most popular occupation in India among those who earn over 50K. To solve this problem, I filter a data set multiple times. First, to create a subset that contains only country, occupation, and salary. Then, I filter the dataset to only contain Indian workers. With that done, the last filter is to include workers who earn over 50K. With that, we can finally group by occupation and count each category, leaving us with the answer. The most popular occupation among the target group is 'prof-speciality.'"
